Credit Risk Assessment in KNIME

🚀 Project: Credit Risk Assessment in KNIME
🎯 Objective:
Predict if a loan applicant is a good or bad credit risk based on historical data, with an emphasis on model interpretability using SHAP.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Workflow
📌 1. Data Ingestion
Node(s):

File Reader or Excel Reader

Description:

Load your dataset (e.g., German Credit Data).

📌 2. Data Preprocessing
Node(s):

Missing Value

One to Many (for categorical → numerical)

Column Filter (drop unnecessary columns)

Normalizer or Z-Score Normalization

Description:

Handle missing values

Encode categorical variables

Normalize numerical features

📌 3. Feature Engineering
Node(s):

Math Formula, String Manipulation, Rule Engine

Description:

Create new features (e.g., loan_to_income_ratio)

Derive credit behavior patterns

📌 4. Data Balancing (SMOTE)
Node:

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

Description:

Handle class imbalance (if ‘Bad Credit’ is underrepresented)

📌 5. Data Partitioning
Node:

Partitioning

Split:

Train: 70%

Test: 30%

📌 6. Model Building (Ensembling + AutoML)
Option A – Manual Models:

XGBoost Tree Ensemble Learner

Random Forest Learner

Gradient Boosted Trees Learner

Option B – AutoML Component:

KNIME AutoML Component (Classification) from KNIME Hub

🔁 Wrap learners inside a Voting Ensemble node for better performance.

📌 7. Model Evaluation
Nodes:

XGBoost Predictor or Ensemble Predictor

Scorer, ROC Curve, Lift Chart

Metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

AUC-ROC

📌 8. Model Interpretability
Node(s):

SHAP for XGBoost

SHAP Summarizer, SHAP Table Viewer, SHAP Beeswarm Plot

Description:

See which features most influence decisions (e.g., loan amount, age, duration)

It is almost impossible to understand the original dataset due to its complicated system of categories and symbols. Thus, I wrote a small Python script to convert it into a readable CSV file. Several columns are simply ignored, because in my opinion either they are not important or their descriptions are obscure. The selected attributes are:

Age (numeric)
Sex (text: male, female)
Job (numeric: 0 - unskilled and non-resident, 1 - unskilled and resident, 2 - skilled, 3 - highly skilled)
Housing (text: own, rent, or free)
Saving accounts (text - little, moderate, quite rich, rich)
Checking account (numeric, in DM - Deutsch Mark)
Credit amount (numeric, in DM)
Duration (numeric, in month)
Purpose (text: car, furniture/equipment, radio/TV, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, vacation/others)
